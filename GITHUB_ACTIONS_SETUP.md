# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow to serve as a merge gate for your Laravel Nutrition app.

## 📁 Files Created

### Workflow File
**`.github/workflows/laravel.yml`** - **Laravel CI - MVP**
- Simple CI pipeline in one file
- Serves as a gate before merging
- Includes: Tests, Build, App startup check

### Documentation
- **`.github/README.md`** - Detailed workflow documentation
- **`GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`** - This setup guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add Laravel CI merge gate workflow"
git push
```

## ✅ What the Laravel CI MVP Checks

### Single Test Job
- ✅ **Tests Pass**: Runs `php artisan test` with SQLite
- ✅ **Build Success**: Frontend assets build correctly
- ✅ **App Starts**: Starts server and checks HTTP response
- ✅ **Fast**: Uses SQLite in-memory database (no external services)

## 🎯 Your Requirements Met

✅ **Project is running**: Tests application startup
✅ **Tests are passing**: Runs PHPUnit test suite
✅ **Merge Gate**: Serves as a gate before merging to main/master

## 🔧 Customization

### To modify the workflow:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/laravel.yml`
2. Commit and push
3. GitHub will run the updated workflow

### To add new checks:
1. Add new jobs or steps to the workflow
2. Update this documentation
3. Test locally first

## 📊 Expected Results

### Success ✅
```
✅ Tests Pass: 112 tests, 311 assertions
✅ Build Success: Frontend assets built
✅ App Starts: HTTP 200 response
```

### Failure ❌
- Check the Actions tab in GitHub for detailed logs
- Fix any failing tests or configuration issues
- Push again to re-run

## 🛠️ Local Testing

Test the same checks locally:

```bash
# Run tests
docker compose exec app php artisan test

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Test app startup
docker compose exec app php artisan serve &
curl http://localhost:8000
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** to trigger the workflow
2. **Check the Actions tab** to see results

The workflow will run automatically on every push and pull request to your main/master branch, serving as a merge gate!
